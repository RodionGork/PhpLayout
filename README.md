PhpLayout
=========

PHP full-stack micro-framework for small sites / applications, it is MVC, featuring "Slim models, Slim controllers" ideology.

Documentation is still in progress, currently it is built into distribution. So, after downloading files and
putting them into your server's htdocs, you can investigate main features starting from the first page.

If you want to see framework in action, please visit [CodeAbbey](http://codeabbey.com) - website for study programming
