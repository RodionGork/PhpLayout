PhpLayout
=========

PHP full-stack micro-framework for small sites / applications, it is MVC, featuring "Slim models, Slim controllers" ideology.

Documentation is still in progress, currently it is built into distribution. So, after downloading files and
putting them into your server's htdocs, you can investigate main features starting from the first page.

Sample project built with this framework is [MessCoder](http://messcoder.sourceforge.net) - website for study programming
by solving small tasks. Project [details page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/messcoder) provides more information.
